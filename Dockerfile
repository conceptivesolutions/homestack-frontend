# First run the build with all dependencies (including dev dependencies, used for typescript)

# add build stuff
RUN apk add --no-cache python make gcc g++

# set workdir, instead of using root
RUN mkdir /app

# Copy in only the parts needed to install dependencies
# (This avoids rebuilds if the package.json hasnâ€™t changed)
COPY package.json yarn.lock .npmrc /app/

# Install dependencies (including dev dependencies)
RUN yarn install

# Copy in the rest of the project
COPY . /app/

# Build the project
RUN yarn run build

# Second Stage
